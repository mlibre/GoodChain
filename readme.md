# GoodChains ðŸš€

This project implements a basic blockchain using both `Proof of Work` (PoW) and `Proof of Stake` (PoS) consensus algorithms.

## Proof of Work Implementation

The PoW implementation is located in the [pow](./pow/readme.md) folder. It includes a simple implementation of the proof of work algorithm.

## Proof of Stake Implementation

The PoS implementation is located in the [pos](./pos/readme.md) folder. It includes a simple implementation of the proof of stake algorithm.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/mlibre/GoodChain`
2. **Navigate to the magic:** `cd GoodChains`
3. **Choose your path:** Explore the `pos` or `pow` directory
